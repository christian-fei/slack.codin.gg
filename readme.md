**This is a simple slack app/bot that makes use of gpt3 ðŸ¤£**

Feel free to improve the project however you like.

## TODO
- [ ] give gpt3 more context, keep a rotating buffer of previous messages
- [ ] set typing for as long as the request towards openai is loading
- [ ] find a way to clear channel messages via pattern matching or slash command (can be implemented on the slack config directly)
