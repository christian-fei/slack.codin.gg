Fork the repo open PR and get in touch üì¨

## Todo
- [ ] give gpt3 more context, keep a rotating buffer of previous messages
- [ ] set typing for as long as the request towards openai is loading
- [ ] find a way to clear channel messages via pattern matching or slash command (can be implemented on the slack config directly)
